### **Feature: MVP Mobile Tor-Based Haveno Web App**
Gherkin/BDD scenarios describing the behavior of a mobile Tor-based web app that communicates with a Haveno daemon via HTTPS to handle hardware wallet transactions. The app will use the hardware wallet as the sole form of identity, and no additional authorization is required.

-- NOTE: For simplicity, 'And' and 'Then' are just 'When' in the code

#### **Background:**
**Given** the user has a mobile device with the Tor Browser installed 
**And**  the user has a hardware wallet (henceforth 'hww') (e.g., Ledger Nano X) either connected or not to the device
**And**  there is an HTTPS server running a Haveno daemon configured for securely handling transactions
**And**  the Haveno-Web app is connected to the Internet

#### **Scenario 1: Warning that the hardware wallet is NOT connected**

**Given** the web app is opened
**And** the LNS hww is NOT connected
**And** it should ensure the navigation menu is disabled
**Then** it should display a message informing the user not connected


#### **Scenario 2: hww NOT connected, user clicks the 'Connect Hardware' button, navs to Hardware page**

**Given** the web app is opened
**And** the LNS hww is NOT connected
**When** the user clicks the 'Connect Hardware' button
**Then** it hides the popup
**And** it should display the Hardware page
**And** it should display the 'Connected' indicator as Disconnected (red)


#### **Scenario 3: Confirming that the LNS hardware wallet is connected**
   **Given** the web app is opened
   **And** the LNS hww is connected
   **When** the LNS hww is detected
   **Then** the popup should not be visible
   **And** it should determine the LNS hww type
   **And** it should display a constant (no matter which page on) text indicator that the LNS is connected
   **Then** it should display the dashboard




#### **Scenario 3: Display the Haveno core app version number**

**Given** the app is open
**Then** the user can view the correct Haveno version









### **Summary**

These scenarios outline the critical interactions between the mobile Tor-based web app and the user-buildable APK leveraging a Haveno daemon. 
he scenarios cover essential functions like accessing the web app, connecting hardware wallets, initiating and handling transactions, and 
ensuring secure communication.
