#### **Background:**
**Given** as per main.features
**And**  the user wants to interact with the Hardware XMR application

---

#### **Scenario 2: Initiating a Transaction**

**Given** the user has connected their hardware wallet to the mobile web app 
**When** the user initiates a transaction in the web app (e.g., sending Monero) 
**When** the web app sends the transaction request to the backend service
**Then** the backend service should receive the transaction request 
**When** the backend service should relay the transaction request to the Haveno daemon for processing 
**Then** the backend service should return the transaction status to the web app 

---

#### **Scenario 3: Handling Transaction Approval**

**Given** the user initiates a transaction 
**When** the transaction request is received by the backend service 
**When** the user needs to approve the transaction using the hardware wallet 
**Then** the web app should display a prompt to the user indicating that transaction approval is required 
**When** the user should approve the transaction on their hardware wallet 
**When** the hardware wallet should send the approval to the backend service 
**When** the backend service should forward the approval to the Haveno daemon 
**Then** the web app should display a success message upon receiving confirmation of the approved transaction 

---

#### **Scenario 4: Handling Transaction Failures**

**Given** the user initiates a transaction 
**When** the transaction request is received by the backend service 
**When** the user encounters an issue (e.g., insufficient funds, hardware wallet error) during transaction approval 
**Then** the backend service should send a failure message to the web app 
**When** the web app should display an error message indicating the reason for the failure 
**Then** the user should be able to retry or correct the issue based on the error message 

---

#### **Scenario 5: Secure Communication**

**Given** the user is interacting with the web app over Tor 
**When** the web app communicates with the backend service via HTTPS 
**Then** all data exchanged between the web app and backend service should be encrypted 
**And** the communication should be secure against eavesdropping and tampering 

---

#### **Scenario 6: Device and Network Security**

**Given** the user is using the Tor network to access the web app 
**When** the user connects their hardware wallet and initiates transactions 
**Then** the web app and backend service should handle all data securely, considering both the Tor network and local device security 
**And** no sensitive data should be exposed or stored insecurely on the device 

### **Summary**

These scenarios outline the critical interactions between the mobile Tor-based web app and the user-buildable backend service leveraging a Haveno daemon. 
The scenarios cover essential functions like accessing the web app, connecting hardware wallets, initiating and handling transactions, and 
ensuring secure communication.
