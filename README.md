# Production Website
REF: https://haveno-web-dev.netlify.app/

ðŸ‘‰ Haveno-Web is the web based front end for the Haveno project

This site is IN DEVELOPMENT and EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE AT THIS TIME UNLESS EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED BY THE HAVENO PROJECT!!!

# Building
Local:
Start the necessary process (haveno and web server):
`yarn envoyWithBrowser`
`yarn build`
`yarn debug or optimize`

Main site:
To view the site in a locally hosted browser:
`yarn serve`

alternatives:
Click within main VSCode window -> Alt + L + O
or bring up `index.html` from any local HTTP server, for example 
elm reactor [`just type 'elm reactor' in the project directory terminal (below)`]
or [`http-server`]
REF: (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

# Testing
See package.json for scripts
Only a BDD/TDD with CI/CD pipeline approach is recommended/required for any further refactors and/or changes.

# Pre-Production checks:
Update semver version number
Close all current running services in terminals
Test scripts: `yarn relns+plw`
Full test: `yarn rel`
Local reality check - 1 full trade (if possible)
Negate the trade
Commit with AI/manual comment
Push to Origin


# Production:
Close all current running services in terminals
Test scripts: `yarn relns+plw`
Full test: `yarn rel`
Source Control: `Sync Changes`
(Unverified - Will upload contents of ./dist folder and ./resources (whole) folder to production environment 
-- NOTE: Problem with a resource (eg. logo display) may need to manually upload)
Files will be automatically uploaded to production environment (e.g. Netlify or Namecheap - pubic_html) via a sync (to Origin) in vscode 
on master branch, which will trigger the pipeline.
Ensure pipeline pass
Check on Production site
(Optional) Create a git tag for this release if it is fully successfull in production
