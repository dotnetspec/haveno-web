# Miscellaneous
NOTE: The application started with middleware due to difficulties with json translation and CORS. Whilst the middleware is probably still required for the search functionality the login code demonstrates that i, and all the js code in static/mondodb, can theoretically be bypassed
via direct https requests from the Elm code. It is expected that the js will be deprecated over time.
